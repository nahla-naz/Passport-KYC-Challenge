# Passport Document KYC challenge - Image processing with OpenCV
Detect Passport document from image, crop it and correct its orientation.

*Tools used :  OpenCV, Rembg, Mediapipe, FastAPI*

# Pre-requisites:
1. Python version : 3.11
2. Install all dependencies in requirements.txt

# Instructions:

1. Run App_main.py to start the Fast API application

2. To test :

Go to the Swagger URL to test with different Passport document images : " http://localhost:8000/docs " (Change IP and Port in CONFIG.ini file if needed)


3. Result image saved as "BASE64_OUTPUT.png" in working directory.

4. Change configuration in CONFIG.ini file - adjust area_threshold based on image quality. (can be decided after testing)



# Detailed description: 


PIPELINE: 

1. Check Document size using OpenCV contours (Check size.py): The Area of image and Area of document are compared to determine whether the document image is already cropped.

2. Rembg model for Background removal (Document_Crop1.py): If Document is not cropped, image is sent to Rembg model to turn the background into black colour.

3. Crop document using OpenCV contours(Document_Crop2.py):  After removing the background, document is cropped using OpenCV contours.

4. Correct orientation of Document using OpenCV (Correct_Orientation2.py): After cropping the document, orientation is corrected using cv2.HoughLines

Note: This method was used instead of pytesseract Orientation and Script detection (pytesseract.image_to_osd - in Correct_Orientation1.py ) for better accuracy.

5. Face orientation using Mediapipe (Detect_face.py): For further correction of document image, image is rotated until Face is detected.

6. Padding using OpenCV

7. Convert image to Base64 string and save the image as BASE64_OUTPUT.png
